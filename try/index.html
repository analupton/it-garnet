        <p>Just west of Arkansas’s capital city of Little Rock, Pinnacle Mountain stands as the centerpiece of this geographically 
            diverse state park. This day-use park offers a variety of outdoor adventures on the Big and Little Maumelle Rivers, in the 
            Arkansas Arboretum, and along over 22 miles of trails including over 14 miles of challenging mountain bike trails. Hike to 
            the top, explore the rivers or take in one of the many interpretive programs offered by park staff. Visit the park visitor 
            center, enjoy a picnic, or reserve a pavilion for a larger gathering. Loblolly Outpost will be located at the Pinnacle 
            Mountain State Park visitor center. Be sure to stop by!</p>
        <p>Pinnacle Mountain State Park is also certified as a Trails of Tears National Historic Site. The mountain witnessed the 
            hardships faced by the removal parties of the Cherokees, as well as, Choctaws, Creeks, Seminoles, and Chickasaws. Learn
            more about the Trail of Tears in Arkansas state parks.</p>

        <li>Spend the afternoon at one of Arkansas' prettiest spots. Rising more than 1,000 feet above the 
            Arkansas River Valley, the cone-shaped peak of Pinnacle Mountain is a central Arkansas landmark. 
            Once up top (a fairly easy hike up the western slope at a slow pace), the scenery can't be beat.

        <li>Generally considered a challenging route, it takes an average of 4 h 41 min to complete. This is a 
            very popular area for hiking and running, so you'll likely encounter other people while exploring. 
            The trail is open year-round and is beautiful to visit anytime. Dogs are welcome, but must be on a leash.

        <li>Besides the more than 40 miles of hiking trails, there are also the Arkansas Arboretum, 
            a playground and plenty of picnic tables.
