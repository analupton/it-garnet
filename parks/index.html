      <h2>What to know</h2>
      <p>Just west of Arkansas’s capital city of Little Rock, Pinnacle Mountain stands as the centerpiece of this geographically 
        diverse state park. This day-use park offers a variety of outdoor adventures on the Big and Little Maumelle Rivers, in the 
        Arkansas Arboretum, and along over 22 miles of trails including over 14 miles of challenging mountain bike trails. Hike to 
        the top, explore the rivers or take in one of the many interpretive programs offered by park staff. Visit the park visitor 
        center, enjoy a picnic, or reserve a pavilion for a larger gathering. Loblolly Outpost will be located at the Pinnacle 
        Mountain State Park visitor center. Be sure to stop by!
        </p>
      <h3>Trail of Tears</h3>
      <p>Pinnacle Mountain State Park is also certified as a Trails of Tears National Historic Site. The mountain witnessed the 
        hardships faced by the removal parties of the Cherokees, as well as, Choctaws, Creeks, Seminoles, and Chickasaws. Learn
        more about the Trail of Tears in Arkansas state parks.</p>

          <p> Pinnacle Mountain is a 1,011-foot (308 m) summit and the second-highest natural point 
            in Pulaski County, Arkansas, United States; it is also the primary attraction of the 
            2,356-acre (953 ha) Pinnacle Mountain State Park. Located in the foothills of the 
            Ouachita Mountains approximately 13 miles (21 km) northwest of downtown Little Rock, 
            Arkansas, Pinnacle Mountain is one of the most iconic landforms of the U.S. Interior Highlands.

          <p>Spend the afternoon at one of Arkansas' prettiest spots. Rising more than 1,000 feet above the 
            Arkansas River Valley, the cone-shaped peak of Pinnacle Mountain is a central Arkansas landmark. 
            Once up top (a fairly easy hike up the western slope at a slow pace), the scenery can't be beat.

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Pinnacle Mountain is not a volcano. Despite resembling a cinder cone (a small conical volcano), 
            Pinnacle Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock, the Jackfork Sandstone. Named after Jackfork 
            Mountain in Oklahoma, the Jackfork Sandstone is an exceptionally hard quartzitic sandstone; 
            weathered surfaces are usually beige in color, while fresh surfaces tend to be much lighter.
            The Jackfork Sandstone can exhibit conchoidal fracturing, a defining characteristic of quartz, which, 
            along with its great hardness, suggests the possibility of a metasandstone.

            Pinnacle Mountain is a 1,011-foot (308 m) summit and the second-highest natural point in Pulaski County, Arkansas, 
            United States; it is also the primary attraction of the 2,356-acre (953 ha) Pinnacle Mountain State Park.
            And while Pinnacle Mountain has a distinctive volcano look, it is not a volcano. The shape of the mountain actually 
            came by way of the combined delicate brush strokes of the wind and the years of sculptured erosion of water.
