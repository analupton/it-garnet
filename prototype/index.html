            <p>UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as the Little Rock 
                Trojans, with almost all teams participating in the Sun Belt

                not sponsor football (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little 
                Rock last fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as 
                Little Rock Junior College. Little Rock's main athletic offices 
                are located in the Jack Stephens Center. UA Little Rock offers the following sports:</p>
                <li>Baseball</li>
                  <li>Men's and Women's Basketball</li>
                   <li>Men's and Women's Golf</li>
                 <li>Women's Volleyball</li>
                <li>Women's Soccer</li>
                 <li>Women's Swimming/Diving</li>

                  <li>Men's wrestling</li>
                  <p>Two Little Rock teams that do not compete in the Sun 
                    Belt are the women's swimming and diving team (Missouri Valley Conference) 
                    and wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt sponsors. 
                    Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in 2019, and is the first 
                    Division I program in Arkansas.</p>
                    <h5>Little Rock will move to the Ohio Valley Conference for the 2022-23 season.</h5>
